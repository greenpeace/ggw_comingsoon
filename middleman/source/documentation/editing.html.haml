      %h2 An introduction to HAML
      %p Our main template language is HAML. You can see haml as a HTML preprocessor, just like SCSS.

      %h3 What is HAML?
      %ul
        %li
          A more concise syntax for coding HTML in your Rails app
        %li
          Uses indentation for nesting markup
          %ul
            %li
              Reduces code (no closing tags)
            %li
              Fixes the messy markup problem that often clutters views
        %li
          Uses a CSS-like syntax that is easier to read and compare to your style rules
        %li
          Makes coding your View layer faster
          %ul
            %li
              Note: doesnâ€™t affect render time or client-side performance, simply reduces codingefforts and makes the developer more efficient
        %li
          Easy to learn!
