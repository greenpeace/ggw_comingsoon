##What is this?

<article class="view-mode-full">
  <p><strong>Greenpeace Greenwire Styleguide<strong> is based on <a href="https://github.com/thomasdavis/kaleistyleguide">Kalei Styleguide</a></p>

  <p>In words of the author:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://github.com/thomasdavis/kaleistyleguide">
  "This project aims at making sure your style sheets are fully documented whilst being synchronized with your webpages styles. To do this it actually uses your live stylesheets in so that at anytime you can review how your styleguide looks."
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Main goals and benefits</h3>
  <p>On <a href="http://blog.rjmetrics.com/2012/02/20/our-living-style-guide-writing-maintainable-htmlcss/">RJMetrics</a>, Matt Monihan counts some goals and benefits when using a Styleguide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a workflow for creating and understanding new markup.</li>
      <li>Improve the maintainability of the markup.</li>
      <li>Give developers a logical and consistent way to markup HTML.</li>
      <li>Impose markup standards within a growing organization.</li>
      <li>Make it obvious when something strays from being consistent with an organizationâ€™s style. It's an experiment, and hopefully generates feedback.</li>
      <li>Save time.</li>
    </ul>
</article>

##Why?

<article class="view-mode-full">
	<p>After reading all the goals and benefits, why not? Anyway, here we have an example:</p>
	<p>Imagine that you want to add some new style or a new component into one of the pages of Greenwire. As a new developer you first have to download the repository from <a href="https://github.com/greenpeace/ggw_styleguide">Github Greenpeace</a>, and once you have everything downloaded, you may want to check what do you have.</p>
	<div class="block block-no-icon">
	  <h2 class="block-title">General view of some of the files inside 'ggw_styleguide'</h2>
	  <div class="content" style="margin-top:15px;">
	     <img src="src/images/dev-tree.png"></img>
	  </div>
  </div>
	<p>At first glance, you can see a lot of files which seem to be well organized. For experienced developers, the organization could be intuitive and easy to understand. For not so experienced as me, at the begining, this could be overwhelming.</p>
	<p>Considering the benefits explained before, using the styleguide may save some time to the first group. But a lot of time to the not so experienced developers. Believe me.</p>

##Setting up.

<article class="view-mode-full">
  <p>To setup your developing branch, you should follow the next steps:</p>
	<div class="block block-no-icon">
	  <h2 class="block-title">1. GitHub</h2>
	  <div class="content" style="margin-top:15px;">
			<p>If you are reading this, I guess you have already cloned Greenwire GitHub repository into your developing branch. Don't know what is Github? Check <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">GitHub documentation</a>. Set it up and learn some basics if you haven't yet.</p>
			<p>Once you setup GitHub, you can clone Greenwire repository in your developing branch using the terminal:</p>
			<p><code class="terminal">git clone git@github.com:greenpeace/ggw_styleguide.git</code></p>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<div class="block block-no-icon">
	  <h2 class="block-title">2. Ruby</h2>
	  <div class="content" style="margin-top:15px;">
		  <p>Make sure you have Ruby, Bundler and RVM installed, we use RVM version 1.9.3</p>
		  <p>If you are on a Mac, you'll require a package manager like Homebrew and the latest version of XCode Development Tools, as well as the Xcode Command Line Tools. Although Mac comes with Ruby, it may not be the right version.</p>
		  <p>Install RVM with Ruby with:</p>
		  <p><code class="terminal">\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</code></p>
		  <p>After installing RVM, run `rvm requirements` in your terminal to see if anything else is required to install Ruby and Rails.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>

<div class="block block-no-icon">
  <h2 class="block-title">3. Ruby Gems</h2>
  <div class="content">
	  <p>Navigate to the theme folder in your terminal and run <code class="terminal">bundle install</code> or <code class="terminal">bundle update</code>.</p>
	  <p>It will read the Gems specified in the Gemfile and install them (and all their dependencies) one by one.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="block block-no-icon">
  <h2 class="block-title">4. Gulp</h2>
  <div class="content">

    <p>We use gulp for many tasks which you can find in gulpfile.js. You need to install gulp on your local environment and in the project:</p>
    <p><code class="terminal">npm install gulp -g</code> // global install</p>
    <p><code class="terminal">npm install gulp --save-dev</code> // local install</p>

    <p>Install the plugins we use:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>Compass, with sass dependencies (gulp-compass)</li>
	    <li>Autoprefixer (gulp-autoprefixer)</li>
	    <li>Minify CSS (gulp-minify-css)</li>
	    <li>Concatenation (gulp-concat)</li>
	    <li>JSHint (gulp-jshint)</li>
	    <li>Uglify (gulp-uglify)</li>
	    <li>Compress images (gulp-imagemin)</li>
	    <li>Clean files for a clean build (gulp-clean)</li>
	    <li>Rename (gulp-rename)</li>
	    <li>Changed, only pass through changed files (gulp-changed)</li>
	    <li>Caching of images so only changed images are compressed (gulp-cache)</li>
	    <li>Size (gulp-size)</li>
	    <li>Combine media queries (gulp-combine-media-queries)</li>
	    <li>Gulp Plumber, make sure gulp doesn't stop on errors (gulp-plumber)</li>
	    <li>Notify of changes (gulp-notify)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Command for single install:</p>
    <code class="terminal">npm install gulp-compass gulp-autoprefixer gulp-minify-css gulp-jshint gulp-concat gulp-uglify gulp-imagemin gulp-clean gulp-rename gulp-changed gulp-cache gulp-size gulp-plumber gulp-notify --save-dev</code>
    <p>This will install all necessary plugins and save them to devDependencies in package.json.</p>
