    about: "Saving the world, one step at the time. We are passionate about protecting the Earth â€“ the only life support system we have. We are independent. That means we can tackle power, not problems. We do this by investigating, documenting and exposing the causes of environmental destruction. We work to bring about change through political lobbying, citizen action and consumer pressure. And we will take peaceful direct action to protect this fragile planet and promote the solutions for a green and peaceful future."
